# Day 2 Review Activity: My Personal Info Generator
# ----------------------------------------

print(" Welcome to the Python Review Activity!")
print("You’ll review variables, strings, numbers, and print formatting.\n")

# Step 1: Create Variables
# TODO: Replace the values below with your own info
first_name = "Alex"
age = 30
favorite_color = "Green"
favorite_number = 21

#  Step 2: Practice String Operations
# 1. Print your name in uppercase
print(first_name.upper())

# 2. Print how many letters are in your name
print(len(first_name))

# 3. Combine your name and favorite color into one message
print(f"Hi my name is {first_name} and my favorite color is {favorite_color}")

#  Step 3: Math Practice
# Use arithmetic operators with your favorite number
number_1 = 22
print(favorite_number + number_1)

#  Step 4: User Input Practice
# Ask the user two questions and combine answers
season = input("What is your favorite season?")
sport = input("what is your favorite sport?")
print(f"I see that you like {season} and {sport}")


# ⚙️ Step 5: Final Challenge (combine it all)
# Use math and strings together
print(f"Your name is {first_name} and you like the number {favorite_number}")
